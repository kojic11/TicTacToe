# TicTacToe

Build with:  ReactJS <br>
TicTacToe is a classic game. Get in a row or in a diagonal same sign in order to win.

### How it works

Made with react hooks. Inital value is empty array (board 3x3) used for storing data ("X", "O"). There is another state which tracks which sign is in order to be placed. If win or tie conditions are met, corresponding screen (component) is displayed. Reset button resets game and sets states to initial(default) value.
